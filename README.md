# AI-Powered Crowd Behavior Predictor

## Overview
This project is an AI-powered crowd behavior prediction system that analyzes pre-recorded video footage to detect potential panic situations before they occur. It utilizes OpenCV, TensorFlow, YOLOv8, and an LSTM-based model to analyze crowd movement patterns and generate alerts.

## Features
- **Crowd Behavior Analysis**: Uses YOLOv8 for object detection and LSTM for time-series prediction.
- **Dataset Handling**: Prepares and encodes crowd behavior data.
- **Model Training**: LSTM-based deep learning model for predicting behavior trends.
- **Web Interface**: Interactive Streamlit dashboard for visualizing predictions.
- **Pre-trained YOLO Model**: Uses `yolov8n.pt` for object detection.
